16. Given an unsorted array arr[0..n-1] of size n, find the minimum length subarray arr[s..e] such that sorting this subarray makes the whole array sorted.
Example: If the input array is [10, 12, 20, 30, 25, 40, 32, 31, 35, 50, 60], your program should be able to find that the subarray lies between indexes 3 and 8.

17. Given a binary array, in which, moving an element from index i to index j requires abs(i – j) cost. The task is to find the cost to move all 1s to each index of the given array.
Input: 
arr[] = {0, 1, 0, 1}
Output: 
4 2 2 2
Explanation:

Moving elements from index 1, index 3 to index 0 requires abs(0 – 1) + abs(0 – 3) = 4.

Moving elements from index 1, index 3 to index 1 requires abs(1 – 1) + abs(1 – 3) = 2.

Moving elements from index 1, index 2 to index 2 requires abs(2 – 1) + abs(2 – 3) = 2.

Moving elements from index 1, index 2 to index 3 requires abs(3 – 1) + abs(3 – 3) = 2.

18. Problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed.

19. Implement a SnapshotArray that supports the following interface:
SnapshotArray(int length) initializes an array-like data structure with the given length. Initially, each element equals 0.

void set(index, val) sets the element at the given index to be equal to val.

int snap() takes a snapshot of the array and returns the snap_id: the total number of times we called snap() minus 1.

int get(index, snap_id) returns the value at the given index, at the time we took the snapshot with the given snap_id

Solution: Use the 2D Array of class Node , the 1D is used to store the indices and 2D is used to store the snap shots. For each index to get the value at particular snap id , we can use binary search as the snap array in each index will be sorted and Complexity of get Operation reduces to log(N).

34. Candy Crush problem: For a stream of integers, all consecutive same numbers appearing more than 3 times would get canceled out. At the end return the remaining sequence of integers. I was asked about the kind of data structure that I would use. The expected time complexity was O(n). Solution: I discussed the approach using stack and keeping track of the top of the stack, I was able to solve it in O(n).
