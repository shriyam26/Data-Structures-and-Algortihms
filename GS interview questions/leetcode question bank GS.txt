22. https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/
23. A question similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/

Also discussed a scenario to merge sorted lists online
24. Design Job Scheduler using message queues (HLD)
25. https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/.
26. https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/
27. the second problem was to find the kth lexicographically ordered string for a given string.
28. Reverse a stack without using any other structure.
29. How would you design thread pool
30. How would you implement Undo-Redo feature in an application
31. Given two strings, return true if one is rotated version of other
32. Given stock prices need to return how many days was ith stock price greatest
Example:
Prices = [10 20 30 40 10 20 60]
Output = [1 2 3 4 1 2 7]
33. How to design a vending machine
34. Add two linked list
35. Maximun subarray product
36. Find LCA of BST. Then followed up for Binary Tree.
37. Find the difference between two arrays: Two unsorted arrays are given, and you need to find (arr1 – arr2) and (arr2 – arr1). The difference between the two arrays is defined as all the elements from the first array which are not present in the second array, taking the number of occurrences into consideration.
Example:
arr1: [3, 5, 2, 7, 4, 2, 7] arr2: [1, 7, 5, 2, 2, 9]
arr1 – arr2 = [3, 7, 4]
arr2 – arr1 = [1, 7]
38. Given an array of citations, calculate the researcher’s h-index.
39.The Follow-up question was: h-index II
40. Given an imbalanced BST, return the balanced BST.
